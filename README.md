A small web app to stop overthinking and make decisions faster.

You write the thought once, then answer one question:  
**Can you control it?**

---

## How it works
- Type your thought  
- Press Enter or click Continue  
- Choose **YES** or **NO**

**YES** → Stop thinking. Do it.  
**NO** → Let it go.
